In this project I will demonstrate that I have learnt the very basics of HTML and git by:

1. Setting up and cloning a git repository
2. Making a readable and concise readme file
3. Creating the required folders and subfolders for the project
4. Populating these folders with relevant files (index.html etc.)
5. Using attributes and tags in the html files to build a "brutalist" recipe page
6. Using commits and pushes to document changes and update the repo
